The noise
It tends to drown her
She's dying
Listen close
You can hear her
She's screaming
Kill the humans
Their damage goes
Too deep
Kill the humans
Kill them quick
'Cause I can't breathe
She turned for years
In silence
Without us
But now her cries
Surround us
She's screaming
No one listened
To her demands
Now it's ending
And in her hands
Waited long enough
In this hell
Thought that we might
Just kill ourselves
Or at least she was hoping
'Cause we've stayed too long
Now she wants us gone
She's screaming
